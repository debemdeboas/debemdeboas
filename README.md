# ðŸ‘‹ Ciao a tutti e benvenuti!

> I have fully migrated to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/debemdeboas) and this account will no longer be updated.

Welcome to my profile. My name is Rafael Almeida de Bem (he/him), and I'm a software developer currently based in Brazil.
I'm a CommpSci student at PUCRS (Porto Alegre) and a back-end developer at [Nelogica Sistemas de Software](https://www.nelogica.com.br).

### About me

My interests are multiprocessing, distributed systems, SaaS, automation (mainly Ansible), and mid-level languages such as Delphi and C++.

I've worked with Embarcadero's Delphi since the beginning of 2019 and with Ansible since the end of 2019.
Most of the code I've written outside of my current company is open-source and on ~Github~ [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/debemdeboas).
I have ~two~ one cat and two dogs, and I love them to bits.
I speak fluent Portuguese (my mother tongue) and English. I'm also studying Italian and Japanese.
